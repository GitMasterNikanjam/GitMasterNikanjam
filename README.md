# Hi, I'm Mohammad Nikanjam 👋

I’m an **Embedded Systems & Robotics Engineer**, passionate about building at the intersection of **hardware and software** —  
that “weird, funky” world where creativity and engineering meet (IMHO).  

I design systems that combine **real-time performance, electronics, and C++ programming** to solve challenging problems in robotics, aerospace, and embedded control.
